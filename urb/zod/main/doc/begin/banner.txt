One basic human instinct is the urge to form political tribes.
In a network that fights this urge, these tribes form anyway and
they form badly.  Urbit designs them into the network.

Inspired by the Qing Dynasty, you'll align yourself with one of 
five colored "banners" - %white, %red, %blue or %black.  Urbit's
convention is that political messages are explicitly marked and 
stay within your own banner.

In the Red Banner, politics means revolution or nothing.  A luta
continua!  You might answer to "radical," "socialist," or even
(gasp) "anarchist."

In the Blue Banner, the age of revolution is over, and social
justice in the 21st century is a matter of pragmatic hard work 
and incremental change.  Perhaps you go by "centrist," a
"moderate" or even "liberal."

In the Orange Banner, the 20th century was a big mistake and
needs to be repealed.  You could be a "libertarian" or a
"conservative."  And if you'd like to repeal any *more*
centuries, as a "traditionalist" or a "reactionary" you belong
under the Black Banner.

Finally, politics is not for everyone.  A lord or lady under the
White Banner won't see political messages and can't send any.
