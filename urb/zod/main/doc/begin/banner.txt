One basic human instinct is the urge to form political tribes.
In a network that fights this urge, these tribes form anyway and
they form badly.  Urbit designs them into the community.  

Political discourse across tribal boundaries is almost always
an antisocial act - less communication, than symbolic violence.
A system of explicit tribes makes it easy to suppress this form
of violence.  Without flaming and trolling, it's much easier to 
connect with friends who disagree with you.

Inspired by the Qing Dynasty, you'll align yourself with one of 
five colored "banners" - %white, %red, %blue, %orange or %black.
Pick a banner by the adjective you feel best describes you:

%red     radical, socialist, anarchist
%blue    moderate, liberal
%orange  conservative, libertarian
%black   reactionary, nationalist, theocratic

Or if online politics isn't your cup of tea, choose %white, and 
you won't send or see any political messages.
